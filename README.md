This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from the Coursera Data Visualizations with Python course, instructed by IBM.

## TYPES OF VISUALIZATIONS AND WHAT DATA FITS BEST WITHIN IT
-Line Plots:  These plots feature a continuous line where it only goes one direction to depict a trend.
              The types of data that fit bests are numerical data and date/time data.
              
-Bar Plots:   These plots features one or more vertical or horizontal bars that visualize the count or frequencies of a categorical variable               to show differences amongs different groups.
              As stated prior, categorical data is best suited for being visualized by this type of plot.

-Scatter:     These plots feature individuals data points on a cartesian (x,y) plane, symbolized by icons, commonly as dots. This does a      Plots        good jobs at visualizing trends amongst two or more quantitative variables, and is typically used for regression analysis.

-Box Plots:  These plots will feature a plot with a box and whisker(s), where the box's edges indicate the interquartile range and somewhere              in the middle will be the median, usually indicated by a center line. Additionally, whiskers will pertrude out to indicate                   where outliers may extend out.
             This is great for quatitative data of more than one groups for comparison.

-Histogram:  This plot is great for visualizing the distribution of a sample or data set with the use of boxes representing the 'binning' of              observations for quantitative data.

## DIFFERENT PLOT LIBRARIES AND WHAT THEY'RE GOOD AT
-Matplotlib:  It possessess the most common types of plots for general use. It's sorta like a Toyota Sedan, it's reliable but not really                   remarkable.

-Pandas:      It is built upon Matplotlib but possessess the excellent data manipulation attributes of Pandas, making it great for initial                 data explortation through visualizations. 

-Seaborn:     Much fanciers and specialized for statistical graphs than the previous. It's also integrated with Pandas, making it easier to                transmit Panda dataframes to the graphs.

-Folium:      This library would be used for the visualization of geospatial data.

-Plotly:      This library is more for interactive plots that can be features in dashboards. It's also web-based, meaning it can viewed and                interacted on the web. 

-PyWaffle:    You can make waffle charts with this library.
